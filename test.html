          “Eman Khalil is from 95', a change of millenniums’s child. She has her roots in the Ismailia city in Egypt. Eman has been painting since she first laid her eyes on a brush which has led to a love of the craft, shining through as a painter. She is self-taught with respect to the learning-by-doing mentality. As Emy paintings progressed she began working as a professionel artist 7 years ago. Hard to stop, she has been unable to limit herself to a specific sector of the painting world and on that account she has been working with both private contacts and businesses, national and international. However, on this site you will primarily find her own favorite originals works. (If you intend to find Eman' commissions you can try to snup them out on her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/imankhalill/" target="_blank">insta</a>Instagram; @imankhalill).

          Go to the commissions page for further information about requests for commissions.
